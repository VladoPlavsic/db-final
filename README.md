5th semester MPEI database course final task

Final task for database course 5th semester AVTI MPEI

The task was to create database for a bank or some sort of a call center from where people are going to call and suggest you some sort of services they offer.

Goal for this project is to make a web app that will simulate interface for two types of users. Administrators and managers. 
Will be using VUE.js for frontend and functionality, Python for database manipulation, and creating API routes using FastAPI.
Communication between two servers is done exclusivly via API.

There is not much configuration to be done, hosts and ports for database and rest API can be found in config/config.config

Logging done using Pythons logging. Logs can be found src/logger/logs
